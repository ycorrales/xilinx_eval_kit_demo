Known Issue

Item 1: On some Windows based systems 
it has been observed that if the driver is already
loaded when the system boots up, Windows may appear to hang.
The problem appears to be a conflict between the driver
and some USB drivers. The problem is that the USB drivers
stop working and if you have the mouse or keyboard 
plugged into these USB ports they become unresponsive.
This makes it appear the system is hung, but in reality
its just the USB port that is not working. Recommendation
is to try a different USB port. We found this would
solve the issue. This has been seen on an x58 and P55
machine.

Item 2: The x8 implementation for the Block Plus core
On ML555 has difficulty meeting timing. It may be
Necessary to use SmartXplorer to close timing. If using
The v1.12 or v1.11 core see Answer Record 33709 for 
new wrapper file that will help in timing closure.

Item 3: The Linux driver is only proven to work on
Fedora Core 10. It has not been tested on other 
Linux versions.
